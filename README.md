# 2048 Game

A simple implementation of the **2048** game built using **React**.

## Game Description

2048 is a single-player puzzle game where the goal is to combine like-numbered tiles by moving them in one of four directions. When two tiles with the same number collide, they merge into one tile with the sum of the two numbers. The game ends when you reach the 2048 tile or the grid is full and no more moves are possible.
